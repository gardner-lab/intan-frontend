%Before running, make sure you have created the appropriate directory structure
%using ephys_pipeline_mkdirs.m.  Also, be sure to use the following file naming
%convention:
%
%BIRDID_RECORDINGID_[option1]_[options2]_intantimestamps
%
%e.g. lpur35_hvc_mic12adc_playback2digin_[timestamp]
%
%the Intan demo software automatically appends a timestamp.  Run the daemon
%in the "unprocessed" directory, where the Intan files should be saved.  As they
%are processed, they will be moved to the "processed" directory. See the help
%for intan_frontend_main.m for more detailed options.
%
%see also intan_frontend_mkdirs.m,intan_frontend_main.m
